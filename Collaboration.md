# Collaboration
So you'd like to help with the project? Thank you! The more people working on this, the better it can be, and the faster it can become something amazing. Or at least that's the idea. Not sure what to do or how things are set up? That's what this file is for!

### Branch Setup
There will of course be a master branch for the most complete and stable version.
The development is split up into three main branches: Visual, Data, and Functional.

-Visual: This is where all of the work is done on the layouts, designs, styles, etc.
-Data: This is where to put all of the actual animal and app data.
-Functional: This is where all of the work is done on the functionality (not visuals or data).

There may be additional (sub-)branches. They will be explained here as needed.

### Animal Information
Each animal needs to have the following information in its relevant data that will be displayed on its Card:
-Common Name
-Scientific Name
-Photograph (be sure to include source)
-Conservation Status (endangered, etc.)
-Habitat (tropical forest, coral reef, etc.)
-Diet (omnivore, carnivore, herbivore)
-Lifespan (average)
-Size (average length/height, average weight)

And the following information (to assist with organization/searches) which might not be displayed on its Card:
-Phylum
-Class
-Order
-Family
-Genus
-Species

Each animal will also have a unique ID code/number.
