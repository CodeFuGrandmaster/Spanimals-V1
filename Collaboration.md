# Collaboration
So you'd like to help with the project? Thank you! The more people working on this, the better it can be, and the faster 
it can become something amazing. Or at least that's the idea. Not sure what to do or how things are set up? 
That's what this file is for!

### Languages, etc. Used in Development
As this is meant for the web or as a web-enabled application, the front-end(what users actually see and interact with) will be using primarily HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. JQuery and additional libraries/frameworks(to be listed when definitely incorporated) are also used to make everything as modern, responsive, accessible, and simple as possible.

### Branch Setup
There will of course be a master branch for the most complete and stable version.

The development is split up into three main branches: Visual, Data, and Functional.

##### Visual 
This is where all of the work is done on the layouts, designs, styles, etc.
##### Data
This is where to put all of the actual animal and app data.
##### Functional
This is where all of the work is done on the functionality (not visuals or data).

There may be additional (sub-)branches. They will be explained here as needed.


### Development Teams
To keep things organized and prevent people from stepping on each others toes or creating redundant content, please refer to any Development Team Leads that may exist with specific questions or whatnot.

##### Visual Design Team
Decides on the styles and layouts of pages, Cards, etc. and is responsible for bringing them to life on all displays correctly. Also designs and creates any art or graphics called for.
##### Research Team
These people are the ones who dig up all of the neccesary information and picture for each animal and determine what will appear on the wiki page. They pass this to the Functional team who make sure it's added to the data.
##### Functional Design Team
Responsible not only for making sure the quizes, wiki pages, Cards, etc. are working but that animal data is included in the relevant animals data section. 
##### QA Team
These are the incredibly patient folks who test every single button and mouse movement trying to break everything and hoping nothing does. They also handle communication about bugs from Users with the Development Teams.

Each Development Team has the accompanying branch as its main workspace, except the QA Team, which tests all branches, including Master as well as the released version(s).

### Animal Information
Each animal needs to have the following attributes in its relevant data that will be displayed on its Card:
##### Common Name
##### Scientific Name
##### Photograph (be sure to include source)
##### Conservation Status (endangered, etc.)
##### Habitat (tropical forest, coral reef, etc.)
##### Diet (omnivore, carnivore, herbivore)
##### Lifespan (average)
##### Size (average length/height, average weight)
##### Link to the animals wiki page

And the following attributes (to assist with organization/searches) which might not be displayed on its Card:
##### Phylum
##### Class
##### Order
##### Family
##### Genus
##### Species

Each animal will also have a unique ID code/number.
