# Spanimals Version 1.0

### Overview
This is meant to be an educational "game" and website/app where users collect Cards for specific animals. This project will unfortunately sit and gather dust for the time being but will be worked on significantly when I have more time (probably about 3 or 4 weeks).

### Collaboration
Please see the Collaboration.md file for information about how you can help contribute to the project as well as information regarding the development of the project in general. 
Note that I will not respond if I am busy with more pressing matters.

### Encyclopedia Spanimalus
I'd like to create a wiki inside of the app that has the information for each animal contained within but 'buried' in an entry the user has to parse through(hopefully ensuring some educational aspect) as well as the animals picture. This is the section of the app and the process that would be the most time consuming to create and debug. So, it'd be the area that would benefit most from collaboration.

### Gameplay
Players will have to answer questions about a given animals statistics and information such as scientific name, habitat, lifespan, etc. and score above a certain percentage of correct answers to receive the Card. Achievements will be awarded for certain actions and number/type of Cards collected. Points are awarded when a card is collected, based on percentage of correct answers on each quiz(up to the maximum for 100%), and user activity(logging in daily, etc.) and can be used to... I'm not entirely sure yet. Honestly I'd like to try to arrange points being able to eventually be cashed in for real-world donations to conservation organizations. Whether or not they'll have any other purpose is currently undecided.
