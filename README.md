##### Spanimals Version 1.0

## Overview
This is meant to be an educational "game" where players collect Cards for specific animals. This project will unfortunately sit and gather dust for the time being but will be worked on significantly when I have more time.

## Collaboration
Please see Collaboration.md file for information about how you can help.

## Collection
Players will have to answer questions about a given animals statistics and information such as scientific name, habitat, lifespan, etc. and score above a certain point to receive the Card.
